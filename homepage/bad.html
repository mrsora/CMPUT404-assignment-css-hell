                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Darren Wang and I am currently in my 3rd year of computer science. I currently work
                        at Farmlink Solutions as a software developer, and I mainly work with a Vue.js frontend and
                        Django backend. <br>
                        Some of my interests include learning more about machine learning, and procedural generation.
                        One of my latest interests is in the application of BOIDs, artifical birdlike objects and how to
                        best apply them to simulations of nature. I find them extremely interesting as its always
                        shocking to me how 3-4 simple rules can create an object that behaves how an organism in nature
                        would. <br>
                        Some of my non-software related interests include badminton, skiing, video games, playing with
                        my cat (Kimchi) and hiking. Personally, I find that being able to balance an outdoor and indoor
                        life the most important in maintaining high motivation and efficiency in work and play.
